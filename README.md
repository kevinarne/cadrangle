# What is CADrangle?
CADrangle is a card game for those CAD nerds who are competitive about everything. Seriously, even competive CAD? Why can't you be normal?

# How to Play
- Get 4-6 people together.
- Whoever last opened a CAD software is the first judge.
- The judge picks something the other players has to model.
    - These can be whatever you want.
        - "A bunny designed for injection molding."
        - "A planter that reminds me of Cthulu."
        - "Existential Dread."
- Draw hands.
    - From a shuffled deck, turn over the first card.
    - Left of judge starts.
    - Either choose the face-up card, or draw the top card.
    - Continue until all players have 5 cards.
- Set a timer for 5 minutes, and everyone else tries to model using the cards in their hands (plus one free Sketch) and their CAD software of choice to model the goal.
- The judge role moves to the left after each round.
- For each round you win, you get one less card in subsequent rounds.
- First to win 3 challenges wins!

## Nuance
- In addition to the 5 in your hand, you always have a pocket "Sketch" to use. Some cards, like "Loft," give you an additional "Sketch" which can only be used with that card.
- If any player does not like their hand, they may discard their entire hand and draw a random hand with one less card (4 the first time, 3 the second time).
    - They may repeat this until their hand reaches 3 cards.
- CADrangle was designed for Fusion 360, but should work with most parametric CAD. Obviously software like Blender or TinkerCAD won't map well to these cards.
- For each hand a player wins, they get one less card in subsequent rounds. So whoever wins the first hand will only have 4 cards in the remaining rounds. This also means that to win, a player will end up with just a 3 card hand.


# Making Your Own Deck
CADrangle has 52 cards in the deck, which means you can simply write the names of the cards on a normal playing card deck.
- I recommend using a permanent marker so the names won't wash off whenever you launder your cards.
    - If you always play with dirty cards you can ignore that.

# What's Does CADrangle Mean?
I just put some random words after CAD; it doesn't mean anything. Truthfully, I'm not sold on the name myself.
